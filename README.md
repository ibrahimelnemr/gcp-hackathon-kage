## üñ•Ô∏è Local Development

### Backend

1. **Build Docker image**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   docker build -t kage-backend .
   ```

2. **Run the container and development server:**
    ```bash
    # to open container terminal
    docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 -v "$(pwd)":/app -w /app kage-backend bash

    # within container terminal
    python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080
    ```

### Frontend

1. **Build Docker image**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   docker build -t kage-frontend .
   ```

2. **Run the container and development server:**
    ```bash
    # to open container terminal
    docker run --rm -it -p 5173:5173 -v "$(pwd)":/app -v kage-frontend_node_modules:/app/node_modules -w /app kage-frontend bash

    # within container terminal
    npm run dev
    ```

### Docker Compose

Alternately, `cd gcp-hackathon-kage` and run `docker-compose up`

This will build and run both the backend and frontend services, exposing the backend on port 8080 and the frontend on port 5173.
